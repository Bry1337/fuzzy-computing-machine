An open source software that provides news data.

inside AppConstants file based on your selected news url.

```
public static final String SOURCE_VALUE = "cnn";
```

Once you have done that.
You will also have to add this to your application gradle file inside buildTypes enclosure.

```
buildTypes {
    buildTypes.each {
      it.buildConfigField 'String', 'NEWS_API_KEY', newsApiKey
    }

  }
```

Also don't forget to add newsApiKey inside your gradle.properties file

newsApiKey="API KEY GOES HERE"
```
